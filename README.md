Subject: Notice of New Version Control Account and Repository Migration
========

Dear Community,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you of an important update regarding my version control system account and the repositories I maintain.

As of 3/11/2023, I have transitioned to a new account, which will be my primary account moving forward. This change is part of a broader effort to streamline my work and consolidate my projects under a single account for better manageability and cohesiveness.

What has changed?

My old account, Z, is no longer in use.
All active repositories have been moved to my new account, 'Mahmood Dzay'.
The new account is already set up and fully functional.

What does this mean for you?

If you are a collaborator: Please note that your collaboration access has been migrated to the new repositories and I will manage to forward it to each one of you through email to use the new repository URLs for all future work.
If you are a follower or user of my repositories: Please update your bookmarks and remotes to point to the new repository locations or send me an email for the instructions. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but assure you this is a one-time event.

Actions Required:

Collaborators: Accept the invitation to the new repositories if required.
Users/Contributors: Update your local git configurations to point to the new repository URLs.

Support:

Should you encounter any issues or require assistance during this transition, please do not hesitate to reach out to me directly at [Your Contact Information], and I will be more than happy to assist.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in this matter. I am excited about the new possibilities that this change brings and look forward to continuing our work together.

Warm regards.
